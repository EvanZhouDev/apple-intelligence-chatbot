# Apple Intelligence Chatbot

This is a proof-of-concept that it is possible to:
1. Automate calling Writing Tools through code
2. Prompt inject those writing tools to act like a Chatbot

Combining these two, here is a simple Chatbot, powered by Apple Intelligence models.

## Contributing

If you want to recreate this to run in more languages, simply add a PR, with a new file named `chatbot.[language]`!

Also feel free to improve on my AppleScript. It's definitely not the most optimal right now.

## Disclaimers

This only works on Apple Intelligence-enabled Macs (all Apple Silicon Macs), and you must already have access to Writing Tools.

Note that these models are not meant to be used as a Chatbot, and thus will not function extremely well.

Furthermore, also ensure you have the Notes app **open** before running the command, or it may not work properly. Furthermore, do not interact with your computer while the automation is running.

I am not responsible for anything that may go wrong due to the AppleScript automation.

Make sure you have a notes folder called 'Apple Intelligence' before using it. Note: Case must match, it is case-sensitive.
